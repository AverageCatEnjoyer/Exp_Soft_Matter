Calculate:

1) The oscillation frequency of the disk.
2) The average angular velocity of the particles as a function of their distance from the centre of the disk.

Info: 
- radius of the disk, R=50 micron
- radius of the particles r=1.4 micron
- acquisition speed 30 fps 

RESULTS:
-rescale from pixel to micron: 50 micron = 397.6 px
